# Magic UI Generator

Leverage [Magic by 21st.dev](https://21st.dev/magic) to build modern, responsive UI components using an AI-native workflow that prioritizes choice and design excellence.

## Context

This skill leverages Magic by 21st.dev to build modern, responsive UI components. Instead of generating a single standard solution, it focuses on providing multiple design variations to choose from, drawing inspiration from a curated library of real-world components and premium design patterns (Shadcn UI, Magic UI, Aceternity, etc.).

## When to Use

Trigger this skill whenever:

- A new UI component is requested (e.g., pricing tables, contact forms, hero sections).
- Enhancing an existing UI element with animations, better styling, or advanced features.
- Brainstorming different design directions for a specific feature.
- Professional logos or icons are needed (via the built-in [SVGL](https://svgl.app/) integration).

## Execution Workflow

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Review the component description. Ensure the target output aligns with the project's stack (e.g., Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS). Define clear constraints for accessibility and responsiveness.
2. **Generate Variations**: Interface with the Magic MCP server or use the `browser_subagent` to explore 21st.dev/magic to generate _several distinct, unconventional styles_ for the requested component.
   - **Pro Tip**: Use descriptive prompts pushing for modern aesthetics: "avant-garde SaaS pricing table with glassmorphism and animated borders" or "highly immersive contact form with dynamic floating labels."
3. **Present Options**: Briefly describe the generated variations side-by-side. Highlight stylistic differences, layout approaches, and premium features (sticky headers, hover animations, etc.).
4. **Integrate Selection**: Once a favorite variation is chosen:
   - Integrate the fully functional, production-ready TypeScript code.
   - Ensure dependencies (`lucide-react`, `framer-motion`) are installed.
   - Handle proper props, types, and responsive behaviors.

## Strict Rules

- **ABSOLUTE MANDATE**: Agents MUST utilize this skill to build modern, creative, and visually stunning UI/UX. DO NOT build in common, generic, or safe styles. Push boundaries.
- **Choice First**: Always offer multiple premium design variations before writing the final code to the project.
- **Clean Code**: Ensure all generated code is clean TypeScript, accessible, and responsive.
- **Full Ownership**: Treat all generated components as fully owned.

## Supplemental Guidance: Iconsax Library

# Iconsax Library Skill

[Iconsax](https://iconsax.io/) is an intuitive and comprehensive icon library designed for modern digital products, offering styles far superior to generic default sets.

## Context

Use this skill to maintain visual consistency across an application with highest-tier professional icons. The library is optimized for both designers and developers to create a distinctly premium feel.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when:

- Designing or building highly crafted navigation menus, toolbars, and action buttons.
- You need an icon that is part of a cohesive, modern design system, moving away from stale, ubiquitous icons.
- Generating a custom, perfectly styled icon using **Iconsax AI** when a unique concept is required.

## Execution Workflow

1. **Identify Need**: Determine the concept the icon needs to represent.
2. **Choose Premium Style**: Select the style that matches the creative direction:
   - `Linear`: For ultra-minimalism and clarity.
   - `Bold`/`Bulk`: For solid weight and emphasis in premium dark modes.
   - `Two-tone`: For highly branded, colorful, and distinct aesthetics.
3. **Search or Generate**: Find the existing icon, or if it doesn't exist, use [Iconsax AI](https://app.iconsax.io/ai) to generate a custom variation that perfectly matches the chosen style.
4. **Integration**: Implementation using SVGs or web components, ensuring precise alignment and sizing.

## Strict Rules

- **ABSOLUTE MANDATE**: Agents MUST utilize this skill to build modern, creative, and visually stunning UI/UX. DO NOT use common, generic, or default browser/framework icons. Every icon must feel intentional and premium.
- **Strict Consistency**: Stick to ONE style (e.g., only "Two-tone") throughout a single project to maintain high-end polish.
- **Sizing & Alignment**: Follow strict, standard grid sizes (24x24) to ensure absolute crispness on high-DPI displays.

## Supplemental Guidance: Web Artifacts Builder

# Web Artifacts Builder

To build powerful frontend browser-based artifacts, follow these steps:
1. Initialize the frontend repo using `scripts/init-artifact.sh`
2. Develop your artifact by editing the generated code
3. Bundle all code into a single HTML file using `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh`
4. Display artifact to user
5. (Optional) Test the artifact

**Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Parcel (bundling) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

## Design & Style Guidelines

VERY IMPORTANT: To avoid what is often referred to as "AI slop", avoid using excessive centered layouts, purple gradients, uniform rounded corners, and Inter font.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Initialize Project

Run the initialization script to create a new React project:
```bash
bash scripts/init-artifact.sh <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

This creates a fully configured project with:
- ✅ React + TypeScript (via Vite)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 with shadcn/ui theming system
- ✅ Path aliases (`@/`) configured
- ✅ 40+ shadcn/ui components pre-installed
- ✅ All Radix UI dependencies included
- ✅ Parcel configured for bundling (via .parcelrc)
- ✅ Node 18+ compatibility (auto-detects and pins Vite version)

### Step 2: Develop Your Artifact

To build the artifact, edit the generated files. See **Common Development Tasks** below for guidance.

### Step 3: Bundle to Single HTML File

To bundle the React app into a single HTML artifact:
```bash
bash scripts/bundle-artifact.sh
```

This creates `bundle.html` - a self-contained artifact with all JavaScript, CSS, and dependencies inlined. This file can be directly shared in AI assistant conversations as an artifact.

**Requirements**: Your project must have an `index.html` in the root directory.

**What the script does**:
- Installs bundling dependencies (parcel, @parcel/config-default, parcel-resolver-tspaths, html-inline)
- Creates `.parcelrc` config with path alias support
- Builds with Parcel (no source maps)
- Inlines all assets into single HTML using html-inline

### Step 4: Share Artifact with User

Finally, share the bundled HTML file in conversation with the user so they can view it as an artifact.

### Step 5: Testing/Visualizing the Artifact (Optional)

Note: This is a completely optional step. Only perform if necessary or requested.

To test/visualize the artifact, use available tools (including other Skills or built-in tools like Playwright or Puppeteer). In general, avoid testing the artifact upfront as it adds latency between the request and when the finished artifact can be seen. Test later, after presenting the artifact, if requested or if issues arise.

## Supplemental Guidance: Frontend Slides

# Frontend Slides

Create zero-dependency, animation-rich HTML presentations that run entirely in the browser.

## Core Principles

1. **Zero Dependencies** — Single HTML files with inline CSS/JS. No npm, no build tools.
2. **Show, Don't Tell** — Generate visual previews, not abstract choices. People discover what they want by seeing it.
3. **Distinctive Design** — No generic "AI slop." Every presentation must feel custom-crafted.
4. **Viewport Fitting (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** — Every slide MUST fit exactly within 100vh. No scrolling within slides, ever. Content overflows? Split into multiple slides.

## Design Aesthetics

You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.

Focus on:
- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.
- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.
- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!

## Viewport Fitting Rules

These invariants apply to EVERY slide in EVERY presentation:

- Every `.slide` must have `height: 100vh; height: 100dvh; overflow: hidden;`
- ALL font sizes and spacing must use `clamp(min, preferred, max)` — never fixed px/rem
- Content containers need `max-height` constraints
- Images: `max-height: min(50vh, 400px)`
- Breakpoints required for heights: 700px, 600px, 500px
- Include `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Never negate CSS functions directly (`-clamp()`, `-min()`, `-max()` are silently ignored) — use `calc(-1 * clamp(...))` instead

**When generating, read `viewport-base.css` and include its full contents in every presentation.**

### Content Density Limits Per Slide

| Slide Type | Maximum Content |
|------------|-----------------|
| Title slide | 1 heading + 1 subtitle + optional tagline |
| Content slide | 1 heading + 4-6 bullet points OR 1 heading + 2 paragraphs |
| Feature grid | 1 heading + 6 cards maximum (2x3 or 3x2) |
| Code slide | 1 heading + 8-10 lines of code |
| Quote slide | 1 quote (max 3 lines) + attribution |
| Image slide | 1 heading + 1 image (max 60vh height) |

**Content exceeds limits? Split into multiple slides. Never cram, never scroll.**

---

## Phase 0: Detect Mode

Determine what the user wants:

- **Mode A: New Presentation** — Create from scratch. Go to Phase 1.
- **Mode B: PPT Conversion** — Convert a .pptx file. Go to Phase 4.
- **Mode C: Enhancement** — Improve an existing HTML presentation. Read it, understand it, enhance. **Follow Mode C modification rules below.**

### Mode C: Modification Rules

When enhancing existing presentations, viewport fitting is the biggest risk:

1. **Before adding content:** Count existing elements, check against density limits
2. **Adding images:** Must have `max-height: min(50vh, 400px)`. If slide already has max content, split into two slides
3. **Adding text:** Max 4-6 bullets per slide. Exceeds limits? Split into continuation slides
4. **After ANY modification, verify:** `.slide` has `overflow: hidden`, new elements use `clamp()`, images have viewport-relative max-height, content fits at 1280x720
5. **Proactively reorganize:** If modifications will cause overflow, automatically split content and inform the user. Don't wait to be asked

**When adding images to existing slides:** Move image to new slide or reduce other content first. Never add images without checking if existing content already fills the viewport.

---

## Phase 1: Content Discovery (New Presentations)

**Ask ALL questions in a single AskUserQuestion call** so the user fills everything out at once:

**Question 1 — Purpose** (header: "Purpose"):
What is this presentation for? Options: Pitch deck / Teaching-Tutorial / Conference talk / Internal presentation

**Question 2 — Length** (header: "Length"):
Approximately how many slides? Options: Short 5-10 / Medium 10-20 / Long 20+

**Question 3 — Content** (header: "Content"):
Do you have content ready? Options: All content ready / Rough notes / Topic only

**Question 4 — Inline Editing** (header: "Editing"):
Do you need to edit text directly in the browser after generation? Options:
- "Yes (Recommended)" — Can edit text in-browser, auto-save to localStorage, export file
- "No" — Presentation only, keeps file smaller

**Remember the user's editing choice — it determines whether edit-related code is included in Phase 3.**

If user has content, ask them to share it.

### Step 1.2: Image Evaluation (if images provided)

If user selected "No images" → skip to Phase 2.

If user provides an image folder:
1. **Scan** — List all image files (.png, .jpg, .svg, .webp, etc.)
2. **View each image** — Use the Read tool (AI assistant is multimodal)
3. **Evaluate** — For each: what it shows, USABLE or NOT USABLE (with reason), what concept it represents, dominant colors
4. **Co-design the outline** — Curated images inform slide structure alongside text. This is NOT "plan slides then add images" — design around both from the start (e.g., 3 screenshots → 3 feature slides, 1 logo → title/closing slide)
5. **Confirm via AskUserQuestion** (header: "Outline"): "Does this slide outline and image selection look right?" Options: Looks good / Adjust images / Adjust outline

**Logo in previews:** If a usable logo was identified, embed it (base64) into each style preview in Phase 2 — the user sees their brand styled three different ways.

---

## Phase 2: Style Discovery

**This is the "show, don't tell" phase.** Most people can't articulate design preferences in words.

### Step 2.0: Style Path

Ask how they want to choose (header: "Style"):
- "Show me options" (recommended) — Generate 3 previews based on mood
- "I know what I want" — Pick from preset list directly

**If direct selection:** Show preset picker and skip to Phase 3. Available presets are defined in STYLE_PRESETS.md.

### Step 2.1: Mood Selection (Guided Discovery)

Ask (header: "Vibe", multiSelect: true, max 2):
What feeling should the audience have? Options:
- Impressed/Confident — Professional, trustworthy
- Excited/Energized — Innovative, bold
- Calm/Focused — Clear, thoughtful
- Inspired/Moved — Emotional, memorable

### Step 2.2: Generate 3 Style Previews

Based on mood, generate 3 distinct single-slide HTML previews showing typography, colors, animation, and overall aesthetic. Read STYLE_PRESETS.md for available presets and their specifications.

| Mood | Suggested Presets |
|------|-------------------|
| Impressed/Confident | Bold Signal, Electric Studio, Dark Botanical |
| Excited/Energized | Creative Voltage, Neon Cyber, Split Pastel |
| Calm/Focused | Notebook Tabs, Paper & Ink, Swiss Modern |
| Inspired/Moved | Dark Botanical, Vintage Editorial, Pastel Geometry |

Save previews to `.design-previews/slide-previews/` (style-a.html, style-b.html, style-c.html). Each should be self-contained, ~50-100 lines, showing one animated title slide.

Open each preview automatically for the user.

### Step 2.3: User Picks

Ask (header: "Style"):
Which style preview do you prefer? Options: Style A: [Name] / Style B: [Name] / Style C: [Name] / Mix elements

If "Mix elements", ask for specifics.

---

## Phase 3: Generate Presentation

Generate the full presentation using content from Phase 1 (text, or text + curated images) and style from Phase 2.

If images were provided, the slide outline already incorporates them from Step 1.2. If not, CSS-generated visuals (gradients, shapes, patterns) provide visual interest — this is a fully supported first-class path.

**Before generating, read these supporting files:**
- html-template.md — HTML architecture and JS features
- viewport-base.css — Mandatory CSS (include in full)
- animation-patterns.md — Animation reference for the chosen feeling

**Key requirements:**
- Single self-contained HTML file, all CSS/JS inline
- Include the FULL contents of viewport-base.css in the `<style>` block
- Use fonts from Fontshare or Google Fonts — never system fonts
- Add detailed comments explaining each section
- Every section needs a clear `/* === SECTION NAME === */` comment block

---

## Phase 4: PPT Conversion

When converting PowerPoint files:

1. **Extract content** — Run `python scripts/extract-pptx.py <input.pptx> <output_dir>` (install python-pptx if needed: `pip install python-pptx`)
2. **Confirm with user** — Present extracted slide titles, content summaries, and image counts
3. **Style selection** — Proceed to Phase 2 for style discovery
4. **Generate HTML** — Convert to chosen style, preserving all text, images (from assets/), slide order, and speaker notes (as HTML comments)

---

## Phase 5: Delivery

1. **Clean up** — Delete `.design-previews/slide-previews/` if it exists
2. **Open** — Use `open [filename].html` to launch in browser
3. **Summarize** — Tell the user:
   - File location, style name, slide count
   - Navigation: Arrow keys, Space, scroll/swipe, click nav dots
   - How to customize: `:root` CSS variables for colors, font link for typography, `.reveal` class for animations
   - If inline editing was enabled: Hover top-left corner or press E to enter edit mode, click any text to edit, Ctrl+S to save

---

## Supporting Files

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|-------------|
| STYLE_PRESETS.md | 12 curated visual presets with colors, fonts, and signature elements | Phase 2 (style selection) |
| viewport-base.css | Mandatory responsive CSS — copy into every presentation | Phase 3 (generation) |
| html-template.md | HTML structure, JS features, code quality standards | Phase 3 (generation) |
| animation-patterns.md | CSS/JS animation snippets and effect-to-feeling guide | Phase 3 (generation) |
| scripts/extract-pptx.py | Python script for PPT content extraction | Phase 4 (conversion) |

## Supplemental Guidance: Stitch Ui Design

# Stitch UI Design Prompting

Expert guidance for crafting effective prompts in Google Stitch, the AI-powered UI design tool by Google Labs. This skill helps create precise, actionable prompts that generate high-quality UI designs for web and mobile applications.

## What is Google Stitch?

Google Stitch is an experimental AI UI generator powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash that transforms text prompts and visual references into functional UI designs. It supports:

- Text-to-UI generation from natural language prompts
- Image-to-UI conversion from sketches, wireframes, or screenshots
- Multi-screen app flows and responsive layouts
- Export to HTML/CSS, Figma, and code
- Iterative refinement with variants and annotations

## Core Prompting Principles

### 1. Be Specific and Detailed

Generic prompts yield generic results. Specific prompts with clear requirements produce tailored, professional designs.

**Poor prompt:**
```
Create a dashboard
```

**Effective prompt:**
```
Member dashboard with course modules grid, progress tracking bar, 
and community feed sidebar using purple theme and card-based layout
```

**Why it works:** Specifies components (modules, progress, feed), layout structure (grid, sidebar), visual style (purple theme, cards), and context (member dashboard).

### 2. Define Visual Style and Theme

Always include color schemes, design aesthetics, and visual direction to avoid generic AI outputs.

**Components to specify:**
- Color palette (primary colors, accent colors)
- Design style (minimalist, modern, playful, professional, glassmorphic)
- Typography preferences (if any)
- Spacing and density (compact, spacious, balanced)

**Example:**
```
E-commerce product page with hero image gallery, add-to-cart CTA, 
reviews section, and related products carousel. Use clean minimalist 
design with sage green accents and generous white space.
```

### 3. Structure Multi-Screen Flows Clearly

For apps with multiple screens, list each screen as bullet points before generation.

**Approach:**
```
Fitness tracking app with:
- Onboarding screen with goal selection
- Home dashboard with daily stats and activity rings
- Workout library with category filters
- Profile screen with achievements and settings
```

Stitch will ask for confirmation before generating multiple screens, ensuring alignment with your vision.

### 4. Specify Platform and Responsive Behavior

Indicate whether the design is for mobile, tablet, desktop, or responsive web.

**Examples:**
```
Mobile app login screen (iOS style) with email/password fields and social auth buttons

Responsive landing page that adapts from mobile (320px) to desktop (1440px) 
with collapsible navigation
```

### 5. Include Functional Requirements

Describe interactive elements, states, and user flows to generate more complete designs.

**Elements to specify:**
- Button actions and CTAs
- Form fields and validation
- Navigation patterns
- Loading states
- Empty states
- Error handling

**Example:**
```
Checkout flow with:
- Cart summary with quantity adjusters
- Shipping address form with validation
- Payment method selection (cards, PayPal, Apple Pay)
- Order confirmation with tracking number
```

## Prompt Structure Template

Use this template for comprehensive prompts:

```
[Screen/Component Type] for [User/Context]

Key Features:
- [Feature 1 with specific details]
- [Feature 2 with specific details]
- [Feature 3 with specific details]

Visual Style:
- [Color scheme]
- [Design aesthetic]
- [Layout approach]

Platform: [Mobile/Web/Responsive]
```

**Example:**
```
Dashboard for SaaS analytics platform

Key Features:
- Top metrics cards showing MRR, active users, churn rate
- Line chart for revenue trends (last 30 days)
- Recent activity feed with user actions
- Quick action buttons for reports and exports

Visual Style:
- Dark mode with blue/purple gradient accents
- Modern glassmorphic cards with subtle shadows
- Clean data visualization with accessible colors

Platform: Responsive web (desktop-first)
```

## Iteration Strategies

### Refine with Annotations

Use Stitch's "annotate to edit" feature to make targeted changes without rewriting the entire prompt.

**Workflow:**
1. Generate initial design from prompt
2. Annotate specific elements that need changes
3. Describe modifications in natural language
4. Stitch updates only the annotated areas

**Example annotations:**
- "Make this button larger and use primary color"
- "Add more spacing between these cards"
- "Change this to a horizontal layout"

### Generate Variants

Request multiple variations to explore different design directions:

```
Generate 3 variants of this hero section:
1. Image-focused with minimal text
2. Text-heavy with supporting graphics
3. Video background with overlay content
```

### Progressive Refinement

Start broad, then add specificity in follow-up prompts:

**Initial:**
```
E-commerce homepage
```

**Refinement 1:**
```
Add featured products section with 4-column grid and hover effects
```

**Refinement 2:**
```
Update color scheme to earth tones (terracotta, sage, cream) 
and add promotional banner at top
```

## Common Use Cases

### Landing Pages

```
SaaS landing page for [product name]

Sections:
- Hero with headline, subheadline, CTA, and product screenshot
- Social proof with customer logos
- Features grid (3 columns) with icons
- Testimonials carousel
- Pricing table (3 tiers)
- FAQ accordion
- Footer with links and newsletter signup

Style: Modern, professional, trust-building
Colors: Navy blue primary, light blue accents, white background
```

### Mobile Apps

```
Food delivery app home screen

Components:
- Search bar with location selector
- Category chips (Pizza, Burgers, Sushi, etc.)
- Restaurant cards with image, name, rating, delivery time, and price range
- Bottom navigation (Home, Search, Orders, Profile)

Style: Vibrant, appetite-appealing, easy to scan
Colors: Orange primary, white background, food photography
Platform: iOS mobile (375px width)
```

### Dashboards

```
Admin dashboard for content management system

Layout:
- Left sidebar navigation with collapsible menu
- Top bar with search, notifications, and user profile
- Main content area with:
  - Stats overview (4 metric cards)
  - Recent posts table with actions
  - Activity timeline
  - Quick actions panel

Style: Clean, data-focused, professional
Colors: Neutral grays with blue accents
Platform: Desktop web (1440px)
```

### Forms and Inputs

```
Multi-step signup form for B2B platform

Steps:
1. Account details (company name, email, password)
2. Company information (industry, size, role)
3. Team setup (invite members)
4. Confirmation with success message

Features:
- Progress indicator at top
- Field validation with inline errors
- Back/Next navigation
- Skip option for step 3

Style: Minimal, focused, low-friction
Colors: White background, green for success states
```

## Design-to-Code Workflow

### Export Options

Stitch provides multiple export formats:

1. **HTML/CSS** - Clean, semantic markup for web projects
2. **Figma** - "Paste to Figma" for design system integration
3. **Code snippets** - Component-level exports for frameworks

### Best Practices for Export

**Before exporting:**
- Verify responsive breakpoints
- Check color contrast for accessibility
- Ensure interactive states are defined
- Review component naming and structure

**After export:**
- Refactor generated code for production standards
- Add proper semantic HTML tags
- Implement accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, alt text)
- Optimize images and assets
- Add animations and micro-interactions

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Vague Prompts
```
Make a nice website
```

### ✅ Specific Prompts
```
Portfolio website for photographer with full-screen image gallery, 
project case studies, and contact form. Minimalist black and white 
aesthetic with serif typography.
```

---

### ❌ Missing Context
```
Create a login page
```

### ✅ Context-Rich Prompts
```
Login page for healthcare portal with email/password fields, 
"Remember me" checkbox, "Forgot password" link, and SSO options 
(Google, Microsoft). Professional, trustworthy design with 
blue medical theme.
```

---

### ❌ No Visual Direction
```
Design an app for task management
```

### ✅ Clear Visual Direction
```
Task management app with kanban board layout, drag-and-drop cards, 
priority labels, and due date indicators. Modern, productivity-focused 
design with purple/teal gradient accents and dark mode support.
```

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Reference existing designs** - Upload screenshots or sketches as visual references alongside text prompts

2. **Use design terminology** - Terms like "hero section," "card layout," "glassmorphic," "bento grid" help Stitch understand your intent

3. **Specify interactions** - Describe hover states, click actions, and transitions for more complete designs

4. **Think in components** - Break complex screens into reusable components (header, card, form, etc.)

5. **Iterate incrementally** - Make small, focused changes rather than complete redesigns

6. **Test responsiveness** - Always verify designs at multiple breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)

7. **Consider accessibility** - Mention color contrast, font sizes, and touch target sizes in prompts

8. **Leverage variants** - Generate multiple options to explore different design directions quickly

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Stitch → Figma → Code
1. Generate UI in Stitch with detailed prompts
2. Export to Figma for design system integration
3. Hand off to developers with design specs
4. Implement with production-ready code

### Stitch → HTML → Framework
1. Generate and refine UI in Stitch
2. Export HTML/CSS code
3. Convert to React/Vue/Svelte components
4. Integrate into application codebase

### Rapid Prototyping
1. Create multiple screen variations quickly
2. Test with users or stakeholders
3. Iterate based on feedback
4. Finalize design for development

## Conclusion

Effective Stitch prompts are specific, context-rich, and visually descriptive. By following these principles and templates, you can generate professional UI designs that serve as strong foundations for production applications.

**Remember:** Stitch is a starting point, not a final product. Use it to accelerate the design process, explore ideas quickly, and establish visual direction—then refine with human judgment and production standards.

## When Writing Code

1. Use `Fill` for flexible containers, `Fit` for content-sized elements
2. Set `flow: Down` for vertical, `flow: Right` for horizontal
3. Use empty `<View> { width: Fill }` as spacer in row layouts
4. Always set explicit dimensions on fixed-size elements
5. Use `align` to position children within container

## When Answering Questions

1. Makepad uses a "turtle" layout model - elements laid out sequentially
2. `Fill` takes all available space, `Fit` shrinks to content
3. Unlike CSS flexbox, there's no flex-grow/shrink - use Fill/Fit
4. Alignment applies to children, not the element itself

# Frontend Slides

Create zero-dependency, animation-rich HTML presentations that run entirely in the browser.

## Core Principles

1. **Zero Dependencies** — Single HTML files with inline CSS/JS. No npm, no build tools.
2. **Show, Don't Tell** — Generate visual previews, not abstract choices. People discover what they want by seeing it.
3. **Distinctive Design** — No generic "AI slop." Every presentation must feel custom-crafted.
4. **Viewport Fitting (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** — Every slide MUST fit exactly within 100vh. No scrolling within slides, ever. Content overflows? Split into multiple slides.

## Design Aesthetics

You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.

Focus on:
- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.
- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.
- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!

## Viewport Fitting Rules

These invariants apply to EVERY slide in EVERY presentation:

- Every `.slide` must have `height: 100vh; height: 100dvh; overflow: hidden;`
- ALL font sizes and spacing must use `clamp(min, preferred, max)` — never fixed px/rem
- Content containers need `max-height` constraints
- Images: `max-height: min(50vh, 400px)`
- Breakpoints required for heights: 700px, 600px, 500px
- Include `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Never negate CSS functions directly (`-clamp()`, `-min()`, `-max()` are silently ignored) — use `calc(-1 * clamp(...))` instead

**When generating, read `viewport-base.css` and include its full contents in every presentation.**

### Content Density Limits Per Slide

| Slide Type | Maximum Content |
|------------|-----------------|
| Title slide | 1 heading + 1 subtitle + optional tagline |
| Content slide | 1 heading + 4-6 bullet points OR 1 heading + 2 paragraphs |
| Feature grid | 1 heading + 6 cards maximum (2x3 or 3x2) |
| Code slide | 1 heading + 8-10 lines of code |
| Quote slide | 1 quote (max 3 lines) + attribution |
| Image slide | 1 heading + 1 image (max 60vh height) |

**Content exceeds limits? Split into multiple slides. Never cram, never scroll.**

---

## Phase 0: Detect Mode

Determine what the user wants:

- **Mode A: New Presentation** — Create from scratch. Go to Phase 1.
- **Mode B: PPT Conversion** — Convert a .pptx file. Go to Phase 4.
- **Mode C: Enhancement** — Improve an existing HTML presentation. Read it, understand it, enhance. **Follow Mode C modification rules below.**

### Mode C: Modification Rules

When enhancing existing presentations, viewport fitting is the biggest risk:

1. **Before adding content:** Count existing elements, check against density limits
2. **Adding images:** Must have `max-height: min(50vh, 400px)`. If slide already has max content, split into two slides
3. **Adding text:** Max 4-6 bullets per slide. Exceeds limits? Split into continuation slides
4. **After ANY modification, verify:** `.slide` has `overflow: hidden`, new elements use `clamp()`, images have viewport-relative max-height, content fits at 1280x720
5. **Proactively reorganize:** If modifications will cause overflow, automatically split content and inform the user. Don't wait to be asked

**When adding images to existing slides:** Move image to new slide or reduce other content first. Never add images without checking if existing content already fills the viewport.

---

## Phase 1: Content Discovery (New Presentations)

**Ask ALL questions in a single AskUserQuestion call** so the user fills everything out at once:

**Question 1 — Purpose** (header: "Purpose"):
What is this presentation for? Options: Pitch deck / Teaching-Tutorial / Conference talk / Internal presentation

**Question 2 — Length** (header: "Length"):
Approximately how many slides? Options: Short 5-10 / Medium 10-20 / Long 20+

**Question 3 — Content** (header: "Content"):
Do you have content ready? Options: All content ready / Rough notes / Topic only

**Question 4 — Inline Editing** (header: "Editing"):
Do you need to edit text directly in the browser after generation? Options:
- "Yes (Recommended)" — Can edit text in-browser, auto-save to localStorage, export file
- "No" — Presentation only, keeps file smaller

**Remember the user's editing choice — it determines whether edit-related code is included in Phase 3.**

If user has content, ask them to share it.

### Step 1.2: Image Evaluation (if images provided)

If user selected "No images" → skip to Phase 2.

If user provides an image folder:
1. **Scan** — List all image files (.png, .jpg, .svg, .webp, etc.)
2. **View each image** — Use the Read tool (AI assistant is multimodal)
3. **Evaluate** — For each: what it shows, USABLE or NOT USABLE (with reason), what concept it represents, dominant colors
4. **Co-design the outline** — Curated images inform slide structure alongside text. This is NOT "plan slides then add images" — design around both from the start (e.g., 3 screenshots → 3 feature slides, 1 logo → title/closing slide)
5. **Confirm via AskUserQuestion** (header: "Outline"): "Does this slide outline and image selection look right?" Options: Looks good / Adjust images / Adjust outline

**Logo in previews:** If a usable logo was identified, embed it (base64) into each style preview in Phase 2 — the user sees their brand styled three different ways.

---

## Phase 2: Style Discovery

**This is the "show, don't tell" phase.** Most people can't articulate design preferences in words.

### Step 2.0: Style Path

Ask how they want to choose (header: "Style"):
- "Show me options" (recommended) — Generate 3 previews based on mood
- "I know what I want" — Pick from preset list directly

**If direct selection:** Show preset picker and skip to Phase 3. Available presets are defined in STYLE_PRESETS.md.

### Step 2.1: Mood Selection (Guided Discovery)

Ask (header: "Vibe", multiSelect: true, max 2):
What feeling should the audience have? Options:
- Impressed/Confident — Professional, trustworthy
- Excited/Energized — Innovative, bold
- Calm/Focused — Clear, thoughtful
- Inspired/Moved — Emotional, memorable

### Step 2.2: Generate 3 Style Previews

Based on mood, generate 3 distinct single-slide HTML previews showing typography, colors, animation, and overall aesthetic. Read STYLE_PRESETS.md for available presets and their specifications.

| Mood | Suggested Presets |
|------|-------------------|
| Impressed/Confident | Bold Signal, Electric Studio, Dark Botanical |
| Excited/Energized | Creative Voltage, Neon Cyber, Split Pastel |
| Calm/Focused | Notebook Tabs, Paper & Ink, Swiss Modern |
| Inspired/Moved | Dark Botanical, Vintage Editorial, Pastel Geometry |

Save previews to `.design-previews/slide-previews/` (style-a.html, style-b.html, style-c.html). Each should be self-contained, ~50-100 lines, showing one animated title slide.

Open each preview automatically for the user.

### Step 2.3: User Picks

Ask (header: "Style"):
Which style preview do you prefer? Options: Style A: [Name] / Style B: [Name] / Style C: [Name] / Mix elements

If "Mix elements", ask for specifics.

---

## Phase 3: Generate Presentation

Generate the full presentation using content from Phase 1 (text, or text + curated images) and style from Phase 2.

If images were provided, the slide outline already incorporates them from Step 1.2. If not, CSS-generated visuals (gradients, shapes, patterns) provide visual interest — this is a fully supported first-class path.

**Before generating, read these supporting files:**
- html-template.md — HTML architecture and JS features
- viewport-base.css — Mandatory CSS (include in full)
- animation-patterns.md — Animation reference for the chosen feeling

**Key requirements:**
- Single self-contained HTML file, all CSS/JS inline
- Include the FULL contents of viewport-base.css in the `<style>` block
- Use fonts from Fontshare or Google Fonts — never system fonts
- Add detailed comments explaining each section
- Every section needs a clear `/* === SECTION NAME === */` comment block

---

## Phase 4: PPT Conversion

When converting PowerPoint files:

1. **Extract content** — Run `python scripts/extract-pptx.py <input.pptx> <output_dir>` (install python-pptx if needed: `pip install python-pptx`)
2. **Confirm with user** — Present extracted slide titles, content summaries, and image counts
3. **Style selection** — Proceed to Phase 2 for style discovery
4. **Generate HTML** — Convert to chosen style, preserving all text, images (from assets/), slide order, and speaker notes (as HTML comments)

---

## Phase 5: Delivery

1. **Clean up** — Delete `.design-previews/slide-previews/` if it exists
2. **Open** — Use `open [filename].html` to launch in browser
3. **Summarize** — Tell the user:
   - File location, style name, slide count
   - Navigation: Arrow keys, Space, scroll/swipe, click nav dots
   - How to customize: `:root` CSS variables for colors, font link for typography, `.reveal` class for animations
   - If inline editing was enabled: Hover top-left corner or press E to enter edit mode, click any text to edit, Ctrl+S to save

---

## Supporting Files

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|-------------|
| STYLE_PRESETS.md | 12 curated visual presets with colors, fonts, and signature elements | Phase 2 (style selection) |
| viewport-base.css | Mandatory responsive CSS — copy into every presentation | Phase 3 (generation) |
| html-template.md | HTML structure, JS features, code quality standards | Phase 3 (generation) |
| animation-patterns.md | CSS/JS animation snippets and effect-to-feeling guide | Phase 3 (generation) |

# Iconsax Library Skill

[Iconsax](https://iconsax.io/) is an intuitive and comprehensive icon library designed for modern digital products, offering styles far superior to generic default sets.

## Context

Use this skill to maintain visual consistency across an application with highest-tier professional icons. The library is optimized for both designers and developers to create a distinctly premium feel.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when:

- Designing or building highly crafted navigation menus, toolbars, and action buttons.
- You need an icon that is part of a cohesive, modern design system, moving away from stale, ubiquitous icons.
- Generating a custom, perfectly styled icon using **Iconsax AI** when a unique concept is required.

## Execution Workflow

1. **Identify Need**: Determine the concept the icon needs to represent.
2. **Choose Premium Style**: Select the style that matches the creative direction:
   - `Linear`: For ultra-minimalism and clarity.
   - `Bold`/`Bulk`: For solid weight and emphasis in premium dark modes.
   - `Two-tone`: For highly branded, colorful, and distinct aesthetics.
3. **Search or Generate**: Find the existing icon, or if it doesn't exist, use [Iconsax AI](https://app.iconsax.io/ai) to generate a custom variation that perfectly matches the chosen style.
4. **Integration**: Implementation using SVGs or web components, ensuring precise alignment and sizing.

## Strict Rules

- **ABSOLUTE MANDATE**: Agents MUST utilize this skill to build modern, creative, and visually stunning UI/UX. DO NOT use common, generic, or default browser/framework icons. Every icon must feel intentional and premium.
- **Strict Consistency**: Stick to ONE style (e.g., only "Two-tone") throughout a single project to maintain high-end polish.
- **Sizing & Alignment**: Follow strict, standard grid sizes (24x24) to ensure absolute crispness on high-DPI displays.

# Stitch UI Design Prompting

Expert guidance for crafting effective prompts in Google Stitch, the AI-powered UI design tool by Google Labs. This skill helps create precise, actionable prompts that generate high-quality UI designs for web and mobile applications.

## What is Google Stitch?

Google Stitch is an experimental AI UI generator powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash that transforms text prompts and visual references into functional UI designs. It supports:

- Text-to-UI generation from natural language prompts
- Image-to-UI conversion from sketches, wireframes, or screenshots
- Multi-screen app flows and responsive layouts
- Export to HTML/CSS, Figma, and code
- Iterative refinement with variants and annotations

## Core Prompting Principles

### 1. Be Specific and Detailed

Generic prompts yield generic results. Specific prompts with clear requirements produce tailored, professional designs.

**Poor prompt:**
```
Create a dashboard
```

**Effective prompt:**
```
Member dashboard with course modules grid, progress tracking bar, 
and community feed sidebar using purple theme and card-based layout
```

**Why it works:** Specifies components (modules, progress, feed), layout structure (grid, sidebar), visual style (purple theme, cards), and context (member dashboard).

### 2. Define Visual Style and Theme

Always include color schemes, design aesthetics, and visual direction to avoid generic AI outputs.

**Components to specify:**
- Color palette (primary colors, accent colors)
- Design style (minimalist, modern, playful, professional, glassmorphic)
- Typography preferences (if any)
- Spacing and density (compact, spacious, balanced)

**Example:**
```
E-commerce product page with hero image gallery, add-to-cart CTA, 
reviews section, and related products carousel. Use clean minimalist 
design with sage green accents and generous white space.
```

### 3. Structure Multi-Screen Flows Clearly

For apps with multiple screens, list each screen as bullet points before generation.

**Approach:**
```
Fitness tracking app with:
- Onboarding screen with goal selection
- Home dashboard with daily stats and activity rings
- Workout library with category filters
- Profile screen with achievements and settings
```

Stitch will ask for confirmation before generating multiple screens, ensuring alignment with your vision.

### 4. Specify Platform and Responsive Behavior

Indicate whether the design is for mobile, tablet, desktop, or responsive web.

**Examples:**
```
Mobile app login screen (iOS style) with email/password fields and social auth buttons

Responsive landing page that adapts from mobile (320px) to desktop (1440px) 
with collapsible navigation
```

### 5. Include Functional Requirements

Describe interactive elements, states, and user flows to generate more complete designs.

**Elements to specify:**
- Button actions and CTAs
- Form fields and validation
- Navigation patterns
- Loading states
- Empty states
- Error handling

**Example:**
```
Checkout flow with:
- Cart summary with quantity adjusters
- Shipping address form with validation
- Payment method selection (cards, PayPal, Apple Pay)
- Order confirmation with tracking number
```

## Prompt Structure Template

Use this template for comprehensive prompts:

```
[Screen/Component Type] for [User/Context]

Key Features:
- [Feature 1 with specific details]
- [Feature 2 with specific details]
- [Feature 3 with specific details]

Visual Style:
- [Color scheme]
- [Design aesthetic]
- [Layout approach]

Platform: [Mobile/Web/Responsive]
```

**Example:**
```
Dashboard for SaaS analytics platform

Key Features:
- Top metrics cards showing MRR, active users, churn rate
- Line chart for revenue trends (last 30 days)
- Recent activity feed with user actions
- Quick action buttons for reports and exports

Visual Style:
- Dark mode with blue/purple gradient accents
- Modern glassmorphic cards with subtle shadows
- Clean data visualization with accessible colors

Platform: Responsive web (desktop-first)
```

## Iteration Strategies

### Refine with Annotations

Use Stitch's "annotate to edit" feature to make targeted changes without rewriting the entire prompt.

**Workflow:**
1. Generate initial design from prompt
2. Annotate specific elements that need changes
3. Describe modifications in natural language
4. Stitch updates only the annotated areas

**Example annotations:**
- "Make this button larger and use primary color"
- "Add more spacing between these cards"
- "Change this to a horizontal layout"

### Generate Variants

Request multiple variations to explore different design directions:

```
Generate 3 variants of this hero section:
1. Image-focused with minimal text
2. Text-heavy with supporting graphics
3. Video background with overlay content
```

### Progressive Refinement

Start broad, then add specificity in follow-up prompts:

**Initial:**
```
E-commerce homepage
```

**Refinement 1:**
```
Add featured products section with 4-column grid and hover effects
```

**Refinement 2:**
```
Update color scheme to earth tones (terracotta, sage, cream) 
and add promotional banner at top
```

## Common Use Cases

### Landing Pages

```

## Design-to-Code Workflow

### Export Options

Stitch provides multiple export formats:

1. **HTML/CSS** - Clean, semantic markup for web projects
2. **Figma** - "Paste to Figma" for design system integration
3. **Code snippets** - Component-level exports for frameworks

### Best Practices for Export

**Before exporting:**
- Verify responsive breakpoints
- Check color contrast for accessibility
- Ensure interactive states are defined
- Review component naming and structure

**After export:**
- Refactor generated code for production standards
- Add proper semantic HTML tags
- Implement accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, alt text)
- Optimize images and assets
- Add animations and micro-interactions

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Vague Prompts
```
Make a nice website
```

### ✅ Specific Prompts
```
Portfolio website for photographer with full-screen image gallery, 
project case studies, and contact form. Minimalist black and white

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Reference existing designs** - Upload screenshots or sketches as visual references alongside text prompts

2. **Use design terminology** - Terms like "hero section," "card layout," "glassmorphic," "bento grid" help Stitch understand your intent

3. **Specify interactions** - Describe hover states, click actions, and transitions for more complete designs

4. **Think in components** - Break complex screens into reusable components (header, card, form, etc.)

5. **Iterate incrementally** - Make small, focused changes rather than complete redesigns

6. **Test responsiveness** - Always verify designs at multiple breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)

7. **Consider accessibility** - Mention color contrast, font sizes, and touch target sizes in prompts

8. **Leverage variants** - Generate multiple options to explore different design directions quickly

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Stitch → Figma → Code
1. Generate UI in Stitch with detailed prompts
2. Export to Figma for design system integration
3. Hand off to developers with design specs
4. Implement with production-ready code

### Stitch → HTML → Framework
1. Generate and refine UI in Stitch
2. Export HTML/CSS code
3. Convert to React/Vue/Svelte components
4. Integrate into application codebase

### Rapid Prototyping
1. Create multiple screen variations quickly
2. Test with users or stakeholders
3. Iterate based on feedback
4. Finalize design for development

## Conclusion

Effective Stitch prompts are specific, context-rich, and visually descriptive. By following these principles and templates, you can generate professional UI designs that serve as strong foundations for production applications.

**Remember:** Stitch is a starting point, not a final product. Use it to accelerate the design process, explore ideas quickly, and establish visual direction—then refine with human judgment and production standards.

# Web Artifacts Builder

To build powerful frontend browser-based artifacts, follow these steps:
1. Initialize the frontend repo using `scripts/init-artifact.sh`
2. Develop your artifact by editing the generated code
3. Bundle all code into a single HTML file using `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh`
4. Display artifact to user
5. (Optional) Test the artifact

**Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Parcel (bundling) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

## Design & Style Guidelines

VERY IMPORTANT: To avoid what is often referred to as "AI slop", avoid using excessive centered layouts, purple gradients, uniform rounded corners, and Inter font.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Initialize Project

Run the initialization script to create a new React project:
```bash
bash scripts/init-artifact.sh <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

This creates a fully configured project with:
- ✅ React + TypeScript (via Vite)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 with shadcn/ui theming system
- ✅ Path aliases (`@/`) configured
- ✅ 40+ shadcn/ui components pre-installed
- ✅ All Radix UI dependencies included
- ✅ Parcel configured for bundling (via .parcelrc)
- ✅ Node 18+ compatibility (auto-detects and pins Vite version)

### Step 2: Develop Your Artifact

To build the artifact, edit the generated files. See **Common Development Tasks** below for guidance.

### Step 3: Bundle to Single HTML File

To bundle the React app into a single HTML artifact:
```bash
bash scripts/bundle-artifact.sh
```

This creates `bundle.html` - a self-contained artifact with all JavaScript, CSS, and dependencies inlined. This file can be directly shared in AI assistant conversations as an artifact.

**Requirements**: Your project must have an `index.html` in the root directory.

**What the script does**:
- Installs bundling dependencies (parcel, @parcel/config-default, parcel-resolver-tspaths, html-inline)
- Creates `.parcelrc` config with path alias support
- Builds with Parcel (no source maps)
- Inlines all assets into single HTML using html-inline

### Step 4: Share Artifact with User

Finally, share the bundled HTML file in conversation with the user so they can view it as an artifact.

### Step 5: Testing/Visualizing the Artifact (Optional)

Note: This is a completely optional step. Only perform if necessary or requested.

To test/visualize the artifact, use available tools (including other Skills or built-in tools like Playwright or Puppeteer). In general, avoid testing the artifact upfront as it adds latency between the request and when the finished artifact can be seen. Test later, after presenting the artifact, if requested or if issues arise.
